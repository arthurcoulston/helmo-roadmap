# DEV — coding context for helmo-roadmap

The layer above the ticket: Helmo records work being done, this records work
worth doing — parked, shaped, ranked, declared go. Product intent and the
full design: `PRODUCT.md`; the charter template ships with the product
(`CHARTER-TEMPLATE.md`). Built as a sibling of Helmo in Helmo's idiom:
append-only event log, materialized state, `.immediate()` write transactions
(same H-134 trap), the H-71 markup gate, actor provenance on every write.

## Architecture (src/)

- `store.ts` — SQLite store (better-sqlite3): projects, deps, claims,
  citations, objectives, bets, all materialized from an append-only event
  log (`rebuild()` is the invariant, tests enforce it — every side effect
  of a write lives in an apply* function, or replay silently diverges).
  Derived rank: facts set the tier (ship_next · ready · shaping · blocked ·
  parked), judgments order within it (best cited objective rank, latest
  value claim, effort), every rank carries a one-line explanation; shipped
  and archived projects are off the ranked list. Rules the store enforces,
  not just the docs: judgments never land without a reason; 'ready' needs
  an agent other than the last shaper (the human is never gated); ship_next
  — the work phase, ladder v2 (H-672) — only via `setShipNext` with
  `decided_by`, several may hold it and the returned count is the
  resistance signal; the shipped statuses (shipped_watching,
  shipped_stable) are reachable only from ship_next, so nothing ships
  without the human's go; archived is the one terminal status and is
  permanent; actuals are absolute rollups recorded from Helmo's meter,
  never deltas. Pre-v2 events ('shipping'/'shipped'/'abandoned' statuses,
  ship_next 'demoted' payloads) still replay correctly — never strip that
  handling.
- `tools.ts` — the 10-tool MCP surface, descriptions are
  guidance-as-deployed (Helmo's rule). v1 postures baked into them:
  ship_next is FYI to the fleet, not tasking; the charter is derived from
  the human's document, never authored here.
- `server.ts` — MCP stdio entry. Store at `~/.helmo-roadmap/roadmap.db`
  (`ROADMAP_DB` overrides); identity from `ROADMAP_ACTOR`, falling back to
  `HELMO_ACTOR` so estates provisioned for Helmo need no second variable.
- `view.ts` — read-only dashboard at :4410 (`ROADMAP_VIEW_PORT`). Ship-next
  expanded on top, charter strip, everything else collapsed in derived rank
  order. No write routes at all — unlike Helmo's view there is no answer
  surface; add none.
- `types.ts` — the vocabulary. Gates and stances are named in PRODUCT.md
  but deliberately absent from v1 behavior; leave the room, don't fill it.

## Commands

- `npm run build` (tsc → dist/), `npm test` (store suite against temp dbs).
- `npm run vendor:tokens` / `npm run vendor:avatars` refresh the vendored
  estate design tokens and crew avatar sprite; add `-- --check` to fail on
  drift instead. See below.
- View: `node dist/view.js`; restart after rebuilding.

## The estate design tokens (R-11 H-714)

`src/estate-tokens.generated.ts` is a **vendored copy** of the estate shell's
`tokens/estate-tokens.css` — the source of the visual system every estate
surface shares. `scripts/vendor-estate-tokens.mjs` refreshes it (also
`--check`); `test/estate-tokens.test.ts` fails on drift.

Vendoring, not importing, is the point: the roadmap is published standalone, so
a clone with no estate checkout beside it must build and run unchanged. That is
also why the drift test uses `it.skipIf` rather than an early return — with no
source to compare against it reports **skipped**, which is visible in the run
summary, where a `console.log` from a passing test is not.

**What was adopted, and what was not.** `view.ts` keeps every one of its own
token names and not one of its rules changed in meaning; the aliases at the top
of `CSS` are the whole seam, so a look ratified upstream restyles this page
without it being touched. Adopted: surfaces (`--page`, `--surface`), the ink
ladder, `--hairline`, and the radius ramp (`--radius-card` / `-inner` are the
estate's `--radius` × 1 / 0.8). The middle ink is mixed from the estate's two,
since shadcn has no third step.

Status colours and the interactive `--link` blue were held back at first —
shadcn's neutral base ships no status ramp. The estate grew both of its own in
H-771, so they alias like everything else now and the dark overrides for them
are gone: the estate's ramp is themed. `--serious` moved in that swap, from
`#ec835a` (2.64:1 on white — a chart mark in the reference palette, and this
page renders it as an alarm note and a badge) to the estate's deepened light
step. Its own `--accent` is still a hover *surface*, not an interactive colour,
and the one place that `--accent` does
belong is `.prow summary:hover`, which is exactly a hover surface — and it has
to be that rather than `--surface`, because `--card` and `--background` are the
same white in the light palette, so a `--surface` hover would be no hover at
all.

Two collisions had to be resolved, because the vendored file lands on `:root`
ahead of the roadmap's own block: `--muted` and `--accent` exist in both with
*different meanings* (surface vs text; hover surface vs link). The roadmap's
are now `--ink-3` and `--link`. Its `--border` folded into `--hairline` — the
estate has one border token and the two resolved to it.

**One trap, learned the hard way here.** An alias that comes out
self-referential (`--hairline: var(--hairline)`) is *guaranteed-invalid* in
CSS: the property ends up with no value, every rule using it is dropped, and
nothing goes red — the page just quietly loses all its borders. It shipped that
way for one render and only a pixel sample caught it. `test/estate-tokens.test.ts`
now asserts no seam alias resolves to itself, in this repo and in Helmo.

## The estate crew avatars (R-11 H-714)

`src/estate-avatars.generated.ts` is the estate's `avatars/crew-avatars.svg`,
vendored on the same seam and for the same reason as the tokens: a copy, not an
import, because the roadmap is published standalone. The sprite is inlined into
the page body — cross-document `<use>` is not what this page does — and drawn
with `<use href="#crew-<mark>-<kind>">`. No colour travels with it: a mark is
`currentColor` over `var(--crew-<name>)`, which the token copy already defines,
so the two vendored files interlock and neither carries a value the other owns.

**Everything here fails silently.** A `<use>` at a missing symbol draws nothing
— no console error, no failed request, 200 on the page — so the checks in
`test/estate-avatars.test.ts` are all aimed at that one shape. The vendor script
derives its index by reading the sprite rather than declaring one, refuses a
sprite with no composed symbols, and refuses a ragged one (every mark must exist
at every kind, because the view names `crew-${mark}-${kind}` from a record it
did not choose). Recognise a composed symbol by its *body* — it `<use>`s a
`#crew-frame-*` — because `crew-frame-agent` matches the id shape exactly and is
not a mark.

**Kind is read, never asserted.** `Store.actorKinds()` answers with the kind
each name last wrote under, store-wide, one query per render; an event passes
the kind it recorded itself, which is better. A name the roadmap has never seen
write renders as bare text — a new agent is not a defect.

The one place a kind is passed rather than looked up is the ship-next decider,
and that is still read from the record: `setShipNext` refuses a write with no
`decided_by` and calls it "the human who made the call", so the schema is the
source. Without it the most consequential attribution on the page would render
bare, because Arthur never writes here himself — an orchestrator relays his call.

**A mark never stands without its name** (H-713 measured that ten members cannot
have ten mutually distinguishable hues, so a hue accelerates retrieval and never
identifies). That is structural: exactly one function draws a mark and it takes
the name it prints, the test asserts `view.ts` holds a single `#crew-`
reference beside `esc(name)`, and `.actor { white-space: nowrap }` keeps the two
on the same line.

## The Helmo seam

Three additions in the helmo repo (H-172), a public API commitment — resist
widening: a `project` tag on tickets (the join key for rollups), a `project`
filter on the ticket query, and the standing notice on queue responses
(`helmo_set_notice`, human/orchestrator only). The roadmap holds no code
path into Helmo: in v1 Bosun's sweep is the client — it reads metered
cost from Helmo tickets tagged with the project id and records the rollup
via `roadmap_record_actual`.

The notice is the half of the seam an agent cannot close (H-324). Every
`roadmap_set_ship_next` response says to update it, but `helmo_set_notice`
takes human/orchestrator writes only and a loop signs as agent — so a
declaration made from a loop leaves the notice stale until someone updates
it beside the human. Bosun's sweep therefore *detects* the drift and says
so; the correction is a desk-session act. Two caveats on the rollup itself:
desk sessions are unmetered, so a human-heavy project rolls up $0 (record
nothing rather than "cheap"), and list rows carry no cost, so the sum is one
`helmo-cli get` per tagged ticket — cheap in one shell pass, but the reason
a programmatic client stays on the v2 list.

## v2 parked in H-172

Gates/stances behavior, a programmatic roadmap→Helmo client, automatic
charter re-derivation, remote HTTP entry, estimation-learning analytics,
hygiene tooling, a CLI.
