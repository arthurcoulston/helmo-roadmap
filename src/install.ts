// Which installation of the roadmap is this process? (H-2472)
//
// The sibling of helmo:src/install.ts, in the same idiom and for the same
// reason: `server.ts` and `view.ts` each resolved `ROADMAP_DB` on their own,
// and an installation had no name — the only thing that said which roadmap you
// were talking to was a database path, and nothing printed it back.
//
// The identity is shared, not invented here. Rev is the supervisor that spawns
// every session and installs the services, and it already names an
// installation: `REV_LABEL`, written into the service environment
// (rev:src/service.ts, H-2452) and inherited by everything it starts.
// `HELMO_LABEL` is the same name for a Helmo-family installation standing
// without Rev — the roadmap honours it for the reason it honours `HELMO_ACTOR`,
// so an estate that has already named its installation needs no second
// variable — and `ROADMAP_LABEL` overrides both. Failing all three, the
// identity is derived from the roadmap's own home, which is the honest answer
// when nothing above it has claimed one.
//
// H-2474 adds the discipline of naming it: each entry point says which
// installation it served, and `--installation <name|home|db>` ASSERTS that
// target rather than choosing it. A disagreement with the environment is
// refused before the store is opened (opening one migrates it), naming both
// candidates — a flag that silently redirected, and an inherited value that
// silently beat an explicit one, are the same defect from two sides.
// `ROADMAP_HOME`/`ROADMAP_DB` move the target; the flag says you meant it.
//
// The single-install experience is unchanged: no variables set at all still
// means ~/.helmo-roadmap/roadmap.db, now under the name `dev.roadmap`, and no
// flag to pass.
