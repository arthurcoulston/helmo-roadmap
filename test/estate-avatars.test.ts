// The vendored estate crew avatar sprite (R-11 H-714). Same seam as
// test/estate-tokens.test.ts, and the same one skip: a clone with no estate
// checkout beside it has no source to compare against, so the verbatim test
// uses `it.skipIf` and is counted as skipped rather than passing quietly.
//
// What makes this set worth having is that almost everything it guards fails
// SILENTLY. A `<use>` pointing at a symbol that is not in the sprite draws
// nothing — no error in the console, no failed request, no red anywhere; the
// page just serves actors with no marks and looks like a design choice. So the
// checks below are all aimed at that one shape: the id the view builds, the
// symbols the sprite actually carries, and the sprite reaching the page at all.
